# Shiva_crater
The repository has three TIFF files, and four python files. Please download the 3 TIFF files from the repository to make sure that the code runs without errors. Do not change the file names during download. The Gaussian Resolution.py file does not require any dataset to work. It is the file which was used to generate the plot to show the attenuation of a 6 km signal.
